# DevelopmentStorage

**DevelopmentStorage** is a shared development space for commissioned and collaborative software projects by [@xyzjesper](https://github.com/xyzjesper), [@xyzspace-dev](https://github.com/xyzspace-dev), and partners.  
It is used to organise and maintain client work, team collaborations, and selected external projects that are not part of the personal or experimental space of [**xyzspace.dev**](https://github.com/xyzspace-dev).

## Projects & Purposes

This repository space is intended for:
- Commissioned software projects  
- Collaborative tools and applications  
- Shared codebases for external usage  
- Hosted work for clients and partners

Unlike **xyzspace.dev**, which is focused on internal, experimental, and personal tooling, **DevelopmentStorage** is more structured and tailored to specific external needs or defined project scopes.

## Collaboration & Access

While most repositories are private or semi-public, collaborators are invited on a project basis.  
Access is typically limited to team members and clients involved in the respective projects.

If you're looking for tools, ideas or experiments, visit [xyzspace.dev](https://github.com/xyzspace-dev) instead.

## Communication

There is **no public Discord server** for this space.  
For client projects, communication is handled via the agreed-upon channels.  
For general inquiries, please reach out via GitHub or through the contact options provided in individual repositories.
